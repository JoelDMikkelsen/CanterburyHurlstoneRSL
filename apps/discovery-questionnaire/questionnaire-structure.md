## Notes on Question Design

- **Plain English:** All questions avoid technical jargon
- **Helper Text:** Each question explains why it matters in business terms
- **Signal Capture:** Questions naturally surface:
  - Multi-entity complexity → Favours NetSuite
  - High integration volume → Favours NetSuite
  - Real-time requirements → Favours NetSuite
  - Simple, single-entity needs → Favours Business Central
  - Microsoft ecosystem preference → Favours Business Central
  - Configuration vs customisation tolerance → Affects both platforms
- **No Platform Bias:** Questions don't explicitly recommend a platform
- **Discovery Focus:** Questions gather context, not final design decisions
